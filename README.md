Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game using Python. In this game, a player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman is drawn. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

How to Play:

    Run the Python script.
    You will be prompted to guess a letter.
    If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. If not, a part of the hangman is drawn, and you lose a life.
    Continue guessing until you correctly guess the word or run out of lives.

Features:

    Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
    Visualizes the hangman using ASCII art.
    Tracks and displays the guessed letters.
    Ends the game when the word is correctly guessed or when the player runs out of lives.

Requirements:

    Python 3.x

How to Run:

    Clone or download the repository.
    Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
    Run the script using a Python interpreter.
